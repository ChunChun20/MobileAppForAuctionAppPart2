# Adroid app with Kotlin

The second ever android app that I made with kotlin that works as a different client for my Flask auction app (check this : https://github.com/ChunChun20/AuctionAppPart2 ). 
There are some bugs but It did good enough job for the project.

# Login page

Really simple login page.
